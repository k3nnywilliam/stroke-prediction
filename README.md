## Stroke prediction

Excerpt from the Kaggle dataset description:
"According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient."

The motivation for this project is to perform a prognosis/prediction on individuals who could potentially get a stroke using machine learning techniques and also to perform a comparative study on different machine learning models.
